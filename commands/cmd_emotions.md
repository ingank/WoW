# Befehle, die Emotionen ausdrücken

Emotionskommandos erzeugen eine Chat-Nachricht (normalerweise in einer speziellen Farbe),
die beschreibt,
was Ihr Charakter tut.
Diese Chat-Nachricht wird oft von Audio und einigen Charakteraktionen begleitet.

Mit dem Befehl `/thanks` wird beispielsweise:
* Text angezeigt: `Foo dankt Bar`
* eine Charakteranimation ausgeführt: Charakter gestikuliert
* eine Audiodatei abgespielt: Charakterstimme, die `Danke.` sagt

Grundsätzlich gilt: Text wird (bis auf `/train`) immer ausgegeben.
Welchen der Kommandos zusätzlich eine Animationen bzw. Audioausgaben zugeordnet sind,
kann der **Tabelle** entnommen werden.

Dabei gilt: Wenn der Befehl in der Spalte
* "Anim" ein "X" enthält, ist ihm eine Animation zugeordnet
* "Voice" ein 'X' enthält, ist zusätzlich Tonausgabe zu hören

Die Tabelle zeigt auch die Unterschiede in der Kommunikation
ohne bzw. mit ausgewähltem Ziel.

**Hinweis:** Zu diesem Zeitpunkt besteht die Tabelle ausschließlich aus englischsprachigen Befehlen.
Die Befehlseingabe wird jedoch in die Zielsprache des WoW-Clients übersetzt und entsprechend ausgegeben.
Eine Erweiterung dieser Tabelle bzw. eine deutsche Version soll zu gegebener Zeit folgen.
